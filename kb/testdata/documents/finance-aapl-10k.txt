Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 23 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2024 2023 2022 Gross margin: Products $ 109,633  $ 108,803  $ 114,728  Services 71,050  60,345  56,054  Total gross margin $ 180,683  $ 169,148  $ 170,782  Gross margin percentage: Products 37.2  % 36.5  % 36.3  % Services 73.9  % 70.8  % 71.7  % Total gross margin percentage 46.2  % 44.1  % 43.3  % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin and Products gross margin percentage increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due to cost savings, partially offset by a different Products mix and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to higher Services net sales. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due to a different Services mix. The Company s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading  Risk Factors.  As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2024 Change 2023 Change 2022 Research and development $ 31,370  5  % $ 29,915  14  % $ 26,251  Percentage of total net sales 8  % 8  % 7  % Selling, general and administrative $ 26,097  5  % $ 24,932  (1) % $ 25,094  Percentage of total net sales 7  % 7  % 6  % Total operating expenses $ 57,467  5  % $ 54,847  7  % $ 51,345  Percentage of total net sales 15  % 14  % 13  % Research and Development The growth in R&D expense during 2024 compared to 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expense increased $1.2 billion during 2024 compared to 2023. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 24 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2024 2023 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 29,749  $ 16,741  $ 19,300  Effective tax rate 24.1  % 14.7  % 16.2  % Statutory federal income tax rate 21  % 21  % 21  % The Company s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7,  Income Taxes  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the  Notes ), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. Other Purchase Obligations The Company s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had other purchase obligations of $12.0 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the  TCJA ) was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 25 State Aid Decision Tax Payable As of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay  14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in connection with the State Aid Decision, all of which was expected to be paid within 12 months. The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board. In May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ( ASU 2023-09 ), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ( ASU 2023-07 ), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company s chief operating decision maker ( CODM ). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26 Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755  $ 3,089  Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139  $ 194  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk ( VAR ) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company s foreign currency derivatives.

Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. The Company s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company s fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis. Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34 Note 2   Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ( SSPs ). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

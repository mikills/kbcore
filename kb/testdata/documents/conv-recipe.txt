George: I tried making your carbonara recipe last night and it was amazing. How do you keep the eggs from scrambling?

Hannah: The trick is to take the pan completely off heat before adding the egg mixture. The residual heat from the pasta and guanciale is enough to cook the eggs into a creamy sauce without scrambling.

George: I used bacon instead of guanciale. Is that a big deal?

Hannah: Purists would say yes, but it's still delicious with bacon. The main difference is guanciale has more fat and less smoke flavor. Pancetta is a closer substitute if you can find it. The real non-negotiable is using pecorino romano, not parmesan - it gives carbonara its sharp, salty bite.

George: I actually used a mix of both cheeses. It was great. Do you put garlic in yours?

Hannah: Never. Traditional carbonara is just guanciale, eggs, pecorino, black pepper, and pasta. No cream, no garlic, no onion. The simplicity is the whole point. The egg and cheese emulsify with the pasta water to create the sauce.

George: I need to try the traditional version next time. What pasta shape do you use?

Hannah: Rigatoni or spaghetti. Rigatoni catches more sauce in the ridges and tubes. Use plenty of pasta water - it's starchy and helps bind everything together.
